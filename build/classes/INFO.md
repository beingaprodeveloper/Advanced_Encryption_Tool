Project: Advanced File Encryption Tool (AES-256)

**Description:**
This tool provides AES-256 encryption and decryption of files using a password.  
It uses Java's built-in crypto libraries without any external dependencies.

**Key Features:**
- AES-256 encryption in CBC mode
- Password-based key derivation using PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256
- Salt and IV generated randomly for each encryption
